<h2>This is the project of SOEN-691 for the Winter 2019.</h2>

The project is implementation of the research paper of <b>Guilherme B. de PÃ¡dua and Weiyi Shang. Studying the relationship between exception handling practices and post-release defects. The 15th International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR 2018).</b>
</br>
For post release bugs, we considered versions </br>
--before = 2018-Aug-8
--after = 2018-June-1
</br></br>
For pre release bugs, we considered versions </br>
--before = 2018-June-1
--after = 2018-May-3

<h3>Anti-Patterns in Exceptional handling</h3>
We consider the following five anti-patterns for the project
<ol>
<li>Nested try</li>
<li>Throw Kitchen</li>
<li>Using getCause()</li>
